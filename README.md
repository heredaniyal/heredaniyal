# 👋 Daniyal Saqib

**CS @ UMT '27 | Frontend Dev | Lahore**

I'm the guy who runs a 527-member WhatsApp group, codes in C++/Java/JS, and hosted an internship event like a TV host. I build console apps easily, learning frontend properly, and figuring out how teams actually work in real development.

Currently grinding DSA at competition level while building my portfolio. Time is money, so I pick projects and people carefully.

## 🎯 What I'm Actually About

**Skillset:**  
Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React—still sharpening), C++, Java, problem-solving at DSA competition level

**What I Can Build Today:**  
Console applications without hesitation. Frontend apps with some time (practice is ongoing). I can explain my code to anyone—communication is my strength.

**What I'm Learning:**  
Full-stack development through freeCodeCamp's curriculum, MERN stack fundamentals, and how to ship actual products that people can buy

**Recent Experience:**  
Completed 2-month Full Stack Web Dev Internship at WiMetrix (Aug-Oct 2025). Didn't just code—networked with the entire company, hosted an event on August 13th where I interviewed everyone like a TV host, and learned what production environments actually look like. Built my foundation through freeCodeCamp's curriculum under team lead guidance.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Languages:** C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js, Git, VS Code  
**Currently Exploring:** MERN stack, building products that solve real problems

## 🚀 Projects & Highlights

**cpp_codes_dani** — My best work. C++ projects since 2023 with data structures, algorithms, and real problem-solving. Personal favorite: `lowertoupper.cpp`—figuring out ASCII logic (97 - 65 = 32) and converting strings without AI. That's the kind of grind that matters.

**java_codes_dani** — All my Java work from summer 2024. OOP concepts, problem-solving, learning through doing.

**js-codes-dani** — JavaScript practice. Building fundamentals, progressing steadily.

**frontend_codes_dani** — HTML/CSS experiments. Learning how to make things that actually look good.

**ChatBot Project (Disbanded)** — Was building a MERN stack chatbot with a team. Realized early the team wasn't communicating, no deadlines, headed for disaster. Disbanded it because time is money and bad teams waste both. Looking for the right collaborators now—I've got the network (Alhamdulillah), just need people who actually execute.

## 🤝 What I'm Looking For

**Internships:** Need one after 6th semester. Hands-on experience, real products, teams that ship.

**Project Collaborations:** Looking for people who value consistency over bursts of genius. Projects that don't get boring. Two is better than one, always—but only if both actually show up.

**What Excites Me:**  
Building products that clients actually buy. Solving problems that matter. Working with people who communicate well and respect deadlines. Projects where I lose track of time because I'm locked in.

**Open Source:** Trying to contribute but don't know where to start. If you've got guidance or a project that needs help, let me know.

## 🌐 My Network

I run a 527-member WhatsApp group of juniors, seniors, and graduates from UMT. We share resources, opportunities, and help each other grow. Networking isn't just LinkedIn connections for me—it's about building real relationships that turn into collaborations.

Hosted events, mentored juniors, and genuinely enjoy the group project chaos (weird for a CS student, I know). Physical interactions > online, but I make both work.

## ⚡ Beyond the Code

- Used to be deep into WWE until John Cena retired (2025). Still catch AJ Styles, The Rock, and CM Punk highlights on Instagram.
- Cricket, football, and snooker when I'm not coding
- Extrovert in CS—I actually enjoy networking and group work
- Believe in working smart: bad teams and unclear goals are time thieves
- DSA competition grinder, not just LeetCode casual

**Real Talk:** I'm here to build things that matter, work with people who execute, and gain experience that actually translates to real-world development. If that sounds like your vibe, hit me up.

**Philosophy:** Time is money. Code with purpose. Collaborate with the right people. Stay consistent. Ship products.
